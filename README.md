Command line utility to find JVM versions on macOS - useful for setting _JAVA_HOME_, particularly on machines with different JVM versions. 

I'm thinking of you, Java Devs with Apple Silicon hardware üê±‚Äçüíª

## Usage

The utility is designed to be used in a similar fashion to the _/usr/libexec/java_home_ by providing 
a number of flags that can be passed to control the selection.

These are shown below:

```
OPTIONS:
    -a, --arch <ARCH>          Architecture to filter on (e.g. x86_64, aarch64, amd64)
    -d, --detailed             Print out full details
    -f, --fail                 Return error code if no JVM found
    -h, --help                 Print help information
    -n, --name <NAME>          JVM Name to filter on
    -v, --version <VERSION>    Version to filter on (e.g. 1.8, 11, 17, etc)
```

### Outputs
By default, the utility ouputs a single path location to the "top" JVM found, ordered by decending version (i.e. Java 17 > Java 8).

Passing the detailed flag (_--detailed_ or _-d_) prints the full details of all JVMs found.

This flag can also be used in conjunction with filters to display full details for the filtered set.

### Filtering

The filtering options of _name_, _version_ and _arch_ can be used in isolation or together to fine tune the selection.

For example, to get the path to Java 17
```bash
javalocate -v 17
```

Or to get the path to the x86_64 JVM for Java 11 
```bash
javalocate -v 11 -a x86_64
```

Or to get the path to latest aarch64 JVM available
```bash
javalocate -a aarch64
```

You can also specify a minimum version by appending a _+_ to the version:
```bash
javalocate -v 1.8+
```

### Exit Code

By default, the utility returns an OK (0) exit code whether a JVM is found or not.

Setting the fail flag (_--fail or _-f_) changes this behaviour, returning a CONFIG ERROR (78) exit code.

This can be useful if you want to use the utility in a shell script.

For example, the below would return an error code if Java 11 or above could not be found when trying to set the _JAVA_HOME_ environment variable:
```bash
export JAVA_HOME=$(javalocate -v 11+ -f)
```

## Building

The utility is developed in Rust and can be build from source using:

```
cargo build
```

Or for a release version
```
cargo build --profile release
```
